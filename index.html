    <h1>How cars ruin cities</h1>
    <p> Cars and car infrastructure can harm cities by contributing to traffic congestion, air pollution, and urban sprawl. The dominance of automobiles often leads to a prioritization of roads and parking lots over green spaces and pedestrian-friendly areas. This can result in less walkability, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and a decrease in overall urban livability. To create more sustainable and vibrant cities, a balanced approach to transportation that includes public transit, cycling, and pedestrian-friendly designs is crucial.</p>

    <h1>Walkable cities are more healthier</h1>
    <p>Walkable cities promote healthier lifestyles because they encourage people to engage in physical activity as part of their daily routines. When cities are designed with pedestrian-friendly infrastructure like sidewalks, parks, and well-connected neighborhoods, it becomes easier for residents to walk or bike instead of relying on cars. This increased physical activity can lead to improved cardiovascular health, reduced obesity rates, and lower stress levels. Additionally, walkable cities often have cleaner air due to reduced vehicle emissions, further enhancing public health.</p>

    <h1>How to change</h1>
    <p>American cities can become more walkable by prioritizing pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. This includes creating wider sidewalks, installing crosswalks with proper signals, reducing car lanes to accommodate bike lanes and green spaces, and implementing traffic-calming measures. Zoning regulations can encourage mixed-use developments, reducing the need for long commutes. Additionally, improving public transportation networks can make it easier for residents to rely less on cars.fostering a culture of walkability involves a combination of urban planning, policy changes, and community engagement to create safer, more enjoyable pedestrian experiences.</p>
